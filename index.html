                          <h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
                          <p><b>November 13<sup>th</sup>, 2008</b></p>
                          <p>In 2008, Bonnie found herself on her first promo job in the heart of Shoreditch, promoting a new mobile phone called the INQ - it was about 12 months after the iPhone had been released, and Jonny had been invited along to write about it on his blog&hellip;</p>
                          <p>While Bonnie had been made to stay an extra 30 minutes of her shift, feeling pretty over this whole promo thing, Jonathan had been enjoying the free champagne with his friend Josh and catching some fresh air outside Shoreditch studios. Finishing up the champagne and with the time running late, Jonny decided then and there that he'd walk in, and ask the first promo person he saw if he could film an interview with them.</p>
                          <p>It must have been fate, because the first person Jonathan saw when walking back into the building was Bonnie, standing alone, waiting for her shift to finish. Apparently his thought process was, "uh-oh she's attractive - just keep walking", which he did. He walked confidently up to Bonnie and said, "Hello! Can I film you for my blog?". Bonnie thought, "yes - something to do! I am a trained performer, yes, go on then, film away". And as a result, our first ever conversation was captured for posterity in the video below&hellip; we are just 20 and 25!</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CqYemQ8rqqw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p>After the interview had finished, Bonnie decided she really liked him, so taking matters into her own hands, she asked, "what are you doing after this?". Jonathan replied, "I'm going for a couple of drinks with my friends, would you like to come?". By this point the final 30 minutes of Bonnie's shift was up, so she got her coat and left the INQ launch with her future husband.</p>
                          <p>The rest, as they say&hellip; is history.</p>

                          <p><b>September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2017</b></p>
                          <p>Almost 9 years later, Jonathan and Bonnie were sitting on a beautiful strip of private beach in Malibu, California. It’s Bonnie’s favourite beach in LA, partly due to its beauty, and partly because it’s where Britney Spears filmed her 2nd music video, <i>Sometimes</i>!</p>
                          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0bPrt69rag?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                          <p>Having just enjoyed a long day in the sun, Jonathan insisted they take a walk along the beach (rather than get an uber) to the restaurant they had booked for dinner. After walking for a while, the sun began to set, so they decided to sit down and take in the beautiful ocean, especially as they were totally alone.</p>
                          <p>After a while of sitting down and enjoying the moment, Jonathan said, "Bonnie&hellip;". As Bonnie looked round in response, she saw Jonathan on one knee, with a Tiffany box and stunning diamond ring looking at her, with a very nervous Jonathan saying, "&hellip;will you marry me?"</p>
                          <p>Bonnie's response was - "ARE YOU SERIOUS…!? YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

                              quintissential chocolate box English village. It's so untouched that filmmakers

                        <p>Lauren is Bonnie's big sister, flatmate of 6 years and all round G! Some of Bonnie's favourite memories with Lauren have taken place on the set of TV shows&hellip;</p>
                        <p>The first was when Lauren had just started out as a makeup artist, and got a job doing Fiona Bruce's makeup for the BBC, so Lauren asked Bonnie to go along to be her assistant for the day. Lauren said, "Bonnie, whatever you do, do not tell her you're my sister!"</p>
                        <p>Bonnie agreed to stay tight lipped and keep it a secret. So as Lauren was doing Fiona's makeup, Fiona said, "so Bonnie, would you like to become a makeup artist too?". As Bonnie knew she couldn't say she was Lauren's sister, she replied - "oh no, I'm just one of Lauren's friends and came to help for the day". Lauren was absolutely horrified while Fiona looked somewhat confused&hellip;</p>

                        <p>A couple of years later, as they were preparing to move on into Sixth Form, Dani got into Arts Ed, Tring Park, the same performing arts school Bonnie’s Mum had attended when she was growing up. In an act of spontaneity, Bonnie decided to book a last minute audition to see if she could get in and join Dani. As luck would have it, they granted Bonnie the audition and she got in.</p>
                        <p>Bonnie and Dani moved to Tring together in the autumn of 2004, and shared a tiny dorm room for two years, and miraculously, didn’t have one argument! It forged a friendship which will last a lifetime, built on such a happy time in both their lives they will never forget.</p>

                        <p>Nick and Jonathan met at BT in 2005, in their first job out of uni. They spent a large amount of time in coffee shops discussing how they would run BT better if they were in charge, and what the best ways to run a business would be. These coffee-shop chats stood them in good stead when they both set up their own companies, and they have continued to meet up on a regular basis over cappuccinos and bacon sandwiches.</p>
                        <p>Nick is also the reason Jonathan got into running - he surprised him with a phone call at 9am one Saturday morning, saying, “What are your credit card details? I’m signing us up to the Berlin marathon”. Whilst Jonathan was not grateful at the time (he had been asleep after a late night out), he remembers this fondly as the trigger for him finding out that he actually enjoyed running.</p>
